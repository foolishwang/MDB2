    <notes>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks!

There have been considerable improvements to the datatype, manager and reverse
modules. Furthermore preliminary support for auto increment and primary keys
has been added. Please note that making a field auto increment implies a single
column primary key on this field.

- increased php dependency to 4.3.0 due to the usage of the streams API since beta5
- fixed typo in _getTextDeclaration()
- alterTable now needs the full definition to work (use getTableFieldDefinition
 from Reverse module if you do not have a definition at hand) this eliminates the need
 of the declaration part in the alterTable array.
- fix PHP4.4 breakage
- improved error mapping (ported from DB)
- better detect if the query returned a result set or not in _doQuery()
- minor tweaks to LOB handling
- use !empty() instead of isset() in fetchRow to determine if result cols were bound or result types were set
- moved all private fetch mode fix methods into _fixResultArrayValues() for performance reasons
- renamed MDB2_PORTABILITY_LOWERCASE to MDB2_PORTABILITY_FIX_CASE and use &apos;field_case&apos; option to determine if to upper- or lowercase (CASE_LOWER/CASE_UPPER)
- use array_key_exists() instead of isset() where possible
- changed structure of field add/remove/change in alterTable() to match MDB2_Schema
- added createIndex()
- return 0 for manipulation queries when disable_query is enabled
- tweaked getTableFieldDefinition() in reverse module
- added getTypeDeclaration() in the datatype module
- tweaked field changing in alterTable()
- fixed alterTable() signature
