2.0.0 stable:
- use constants that we can apply bit operators on for the types internally ..
  this would allow people to define complex types that know that they are text
- move all datatype related code into the datatype module (especially from the
  manager class and the reverse module)
- move all code that is left from the reverse module into the manager module
  as per the patches that Matt send in a while ago
- more PDI API fixes (especially the fetch object needs to be merged with the
  statement object
- separate the manager into a separate table
- write basic Docbook documentation
- test stored procedures
- fix up PEAR::DB wrapper (especially !/& support and error handling)
- add named parameters (thereby also streamlining LOB support)
- clean up manager and reverse module
- explore usage of interceptors for modules
- fix up tutorial

near future:
- add call to EXPLAIN method to the default debug output handler
- expand the test suite to cover the entire API and all possible cases
- write complete Docbook documentation
- add Metabase Wrapper for the OO API
- add support for primary and foreign keys
- add mysqli driver

far future:
- SQL Funtion Abstraction Module (for example SUBSTRING() and SUBSTR())
- move MDB2_Manager functionality into DB_Schema
