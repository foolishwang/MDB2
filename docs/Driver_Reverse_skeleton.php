// This is just a skeleton MDB2 driver.

// In each of the listed methods I have added comments that tell you where
// to look for a "reference" implementation.
// Many of the methods below are taken from Metabase. Most of the methods
// marked as "new in MDB2" are actually taken from the latest beta files of
// Metabase. However these beta files only include a version for MySQL.
// Some of these methods have been expanded or changed slightly in MDB2.
// Looking in the relevant MDB2 Wrapper should give you some pointers, some
// other difference you will only discover by looking at one of the existing
// MDB2 driver or the common implementation in common.php.
// One thing that will definately have to be modified in all "reference"
// implementations of Metabase methods is the error handling.
// Anyways don't worry if you are having problems: Lukas Smith is here to help!
