 <summary>database abstraction layer</summary>
 <description>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

Note that the API will be adapted to better fit with the new php5 only PDO
before the first stable release.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation

    <notes>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks!

There have been considerable improvements to the datatype, manager and reverse
modules. Furthermore preliminary support for auto increment and primary keys
has been added. Please note that making a field auto increment implies a single
column primary key on this field.

- increased php dependency to 4.3.0 due to the usage of the streams API since beta5
- moved logic from MDB2::connect() to MDB2::factory(), the only difference is
  that MDB2::connect will immediatly try to connect to the database
- MDB2::singleton now uses MDB2::factory()
- added support for auto increment and primary key in schema. (mysql[i])
- alterTable now needs the full definition to work (use getTableFieldDefinition
 from Reverse module if you do not have a definition at hand) this eliminates the need
 of the declaration part in the alterTable array.
- nicer test chooser. Added some js magic to [un]select all the tests in a group
- fixed typo in _getTextDeclaration()
- fix PHP4.4 breakage
- ensure that types and result_types property in the statement class is an array (bug #4695)
- added support for fetchmode in the iterator class and for any other result wrapper class (bug #4685)
- moved getInsertID() into core as lastInsertID()
- moved getBeforeID() and getAfterID() from core into the extended module
- added base class for all modules (which provides getDBInstance())
- added free() method to remove an instance from the global instance array
- removed schema manager related error codes from MDB2::errorMessage()
- dont set the include path in test suite (people can do that in test_setup.php)
- added missing default numRows() method
- added hack into stream_eof() to handle the BC break in 5.0.x
- removed uncessary duplicate quoting in quote() in the peardb wrapper (bug #5195)
- warning fix in BC hack of connect() in the peardb wrapper
- tweaked error message in setResultTypes()
- removed PDO compatibility code in bindParam and bindCol, now using 0-index numeric keys again
- expect keys in type arrays the same way as they are passed for the values in execute() and bindParamArray()
- add s pattern modifier to preg_replace() call for parameter searches in prepare() (bug #5362)
- moved all private fetch mode fix methods into _fixResultArrayValues() for performance reasons
- added new portability fetch mode MDB2_PORTABILITY_FIX_ASSOC_FIELD_NAMES (to remove database/table qualifiers from assoc indexes)
- renamed MDB2_PORTABILITY_LOWERCASE to MDB2_PORTABILITY_FIX_CASE and use &apos;field_case&apos; option to determine if to upper- or lowercase (CASE_LOWER/CASE_UPPER)
- ensure that fetchAll always returns an array() even if the result set was empty
- use array_key_exists() instead of isset() where possible
- changed structure of field add/remove/change in alterTable() to match MDB2_Schema
- added default values for supported property
- reworked supports() to return the given value and also return errors for non existant support feature
- reworked subSelect() to use the &apos;emulated&apos; supports() return value
- removed implementation of createIndex() (now every driver needs to implement it themselves)
- sync fileExists with the LiveUser one, explode instead of split and is_readable instead of file_exists.
- tweaked compare method family to better deal with optional properties

open todo items:
- add test cases for the various module methods
- add getServerVersion()

    <notes>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks to make the MDB2 API be as
similar as possible as the ext/pdo API! The next release is likely to also break
BC for the same reason. Check php.net/pdo for information on the pdo API.

  (was missing in some decimal, float, time, date and timestamp implementations)
- renamed getRowCount() to rowCount() for PDO compliance (BC break)
  (doesnt take into account the offset anymore)
- added new quote() parameter to remove quotes (ugly hack will get cleaned up)
- renamed execute() to _execute() since common provides some common functionality via execute()
- fixed some issues regarding limit/offset in prepared statements
- fixed bug in _assignBindColumns() when using associative fetches
- support numeric and string keys in types array for prepared queries
- call trigger error if __call() is unable to find a method in any of the modules
- work around php5 bugs in the test suite

    <notes>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks to make the MDB2 API be as
similar as possible as the ext/pdo API! The next release is likely to also break
BC for the same reason. Check php.net/pdo for information on the pdo API.

Oracle NULL in LOB fields is broken.
The fbsql and mssql drivers are likely to be broken as they are largely untested.

MDB2 static class:
- &quot;xxx&quot; out password on connect error in MDB2::connect()
- MDB2::isError now also optionally accepts and error code to check for
- added LOAD DATA (port from DB) and SET to MDB2::isManip()

All drivers:
- use __construct() (PHP4 BC hacks are provided)
- allow null values to be set for options
- ensure we are returning a reference in all relevant places

- allow errorInfo() to be called when no connection has been established yet
- use MDB2_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED instead of MDB2_ERROR_NOT_CAPABLE in common implementations
- readded MDB2_Error as the baseclass for all MDB2 error objects
- updated error mappings from DB

- added MDB2_Driver_Common::getDatabase();
- reworked dsn default handling
- added ability to &quot;xxx&quot; out password in getDSN()

- use _close() method in several places where they previously were not used
- removed redundant code in _close() that dealt with transaction closing already
  done in disconnect()
- if the dbsyntax is set in the dsn it will be set in the dbsyntax property
- only disconnect persistant connections if disconnect() has been explicitly
  called by the user
- instead of having a generic implemention of disconnect() we will rename
  _close() to disconnect() to overwrite the generic implementation
- added support for &apos;new_link&apos; dsn option for all supported drivers (mysql, oci8, pgsql)

- transaction API moved over to PDO: removed autoCommit(), added beginTransaction()
  and refactored commit() (it doesn&apos;t start a new transaction automatically anymore)
- reworked handling of uncommited transaction for persistant connections when
  a given connection is no longer in use

- added &apos;disable_query&apos; option to be able to disable the execution of all queries
 (this might be useful in conjuntion with a custom debug handler to be able to
 dump all queries into a file instead of executing them)
- removed affectedRows() method in favor of returning affectedRows() on query if relevant
- added generic implementation of query() and moved driver specific code into _doQuery()
- added _modifyQuery() to any driver that did not yet have it yet
- standaloneQuery() now also supports SELECT querys
- remove redundant call to commit() since setting autoCommit() already commits in MDB2::replace()
- refactored standaloneQuery(), query(), _doQuery(), _wrapResult(); the most important change are:
  result are only wrapped if it is explicitly requested
  standaloneQuery() now works just as query() does but with its own connection
- allowing limits of 0 in setLimit()

- explicitly specify colum name in sequence emulation queries
- added getBeforeId() and getAfterId()
- added new supported feature &apos;auto_increment&apos;

- added default implementation for quoteCLOB() and quoteBLOB()
- reworked quote handling: moved all implementation details into the extension,
  made all quote methods private except for quote() itself, honor portability
  MDB2_PORTABILITY_EMPTY_TO_NULL in quote(), removed MDB2_TYPE_* constants
- reworked get*Declaration handling: moved all implementation details into the extension,
  made all quote methods private except for quote() itself
- placed convert methods after the portability conversions to ensure that the
  proper type is maintained after the conversion methods
- dont convert fetched null values in the Datatype module

- removed executeParams() and moved executeMultiple() from extended module

- updated tableInfo() code from DB

- made LIMIT handling more robust by taking some code from DB

All drivers result:
- performance tweak in fetchCol()
- added MDB2_FETCHMODE_OBJECT
- added MDB2_Driver_Result_Common::getRowCounter()
- added rownum handling to fetchRow()
- removed fetch() and resultIsNull()

All drivers prepared statements
- moved prepare/execute API towards PDO
- setParamsArray() can now handle non ordered arrays
- removed requirement for LOB inserts to pass the parameters as an array
- placeholders are now numbered starting from 0 (BC break in setParam() !)
- queries inside the prepared_queries property now start counting at 1 (performance tweak)
- refactored handling of filename LOB values (prefix with &apos;file://&apos;)
- removed _executePrepared(), drivers need to overwrite execute() for now on
- add support for oracle style named parameters and modified test suite accordingly

MySQL driver:
- improved handling of MDB2_PORTABILITY_LOWERCASE in all the reverse
  methods inside the mysql driver to work coherently
- fixed several issues in the listTablefields() method of manager drivers

MSSQL driver:
- added code in MDB2_Driver_mssql::connect() to better handle date values
  independant of ini and locale settings inside the server
- use comma, rather than colon, to delimit port in MDB2_driver_mssql::connect().
  Bug 2140. (danielc)
- unified mssql standalone query with sqlite, mysql and others (not tested on
  mssql yet, but since mssql automatically reuses connections per dsn the old
  way could gurantee anything different from happening)

PgSQL driver:
- use track_errors to capture error messages in MDB2_driver_pgsql::connect().
  Bug 2011. (danielc)
- add port to connect string when protocol is unix in MDB2_driver_pgsql::connect().
  Bug 1919. (danielc)
- accommodate changes made to PostgreSQL so &quot;no such field&quot; errors get properly
  indicated rather than being mislabeled as &quot;no such table.&quot; (danielc)
- added &quot;permission denied&quot; to error regex in pgsql driver.
  Bug 2417. (stewart_linux-org-au)

OCI8 driver:
- fixed typo in MDB2_Driver_Manager_oci8::listTables() (fix for bug #2434)

  if the database_name should be used for connections of the username
- oci8 driver now uses native bind support for all types in prepare()/execute()

Interbase driver:
- completely revised ibase driver, now passing all tests under php5

Frontbase driver:
- fbsql: use correct error codes. Was using MySQL&apos;s codes by mistake.

MySQLi driver:
- added mysqli driver (passes all tests, but doesnt use native prepare yet)

DB wrapper
- fixed a large number of compatibility issues in the PEAR::DB wrapper

Iterator
- fixed several bugs and updated the interface to match the final php5 iterator API
- buffered result sets now implements seekable
- removed unnecessary returns
- throw pear error on rewind in unbuffered result set
- renamed size() to count() to match the upcoming Countable interface

Extended module:
- modified the signature of the auto*() methods to be compatible with DB (bug #3720)
- tweaked buildManipSQL() to not use loops (bug #3721)

MDB_Tools_Manager
- updated raiseError method in the Manager to be compatible with
  XML_Parser 1.1.x and return useful error message (fix bug #2055)
- major refactoring of MDB2_Manager resulting in several new methods being available
- fixed error in MDB2_Manager::_escapeSpecialCharacter() that would lead to
  incorrect handling of integer values (this needs to be explored in more detail)
- several typo fixes and minor logic errors (among others a fix for bug #2057)
- moved xml dumping in MDB2_Tools_Manager into separate Writer class
- fixed bugs in start value handling in create sequence (bug #3077)

    <notes>The core of MDB2 is now fairly stable API-wise. The modules, especially the
manager and reverse module, might see some API refinement before the first
stable release.
- added listTables() and listTableFields() methods to MDB2_Driver_Manager_mssql
  and MDB2_Driver_Manager_oci8
- reversed parameter order of getValue(), type parameter is now optional and
  will then be autodetected (BC break!)
- renamed get*Value() to quote*() (BC break!)
- fixed LOB management in MDB2_Driver_ibase
- moved getOne, getRow, getCol, getAll back into the exteneded module (most
  users should be able to move to the queryOne, queryRow, queryCol and queryAll
  equivalent) (BC break!)
- added getAssoc to the extended module
- fixed bug in MDB2_Driver_Datatype_Common::implodeArray()
- added sequence_col_name option to make the column name inside sequence
  emulation tables configurable
- fixed a bug in the MDB2_Driver_oci8 and MDB2_Driver_ibase buffering emulation
  when using limit queries
- removed MDB2_PORTABILITY_NULL_TO_EMPTY in favor of MDB2_PORTABILITY_EMPTY_TO_NULL
  this means that DB and MDB2 work exactly the opposite now, but it seems more
  efficient to do things the way Oracle does since this is the RDBMS which
  creates the original issue to begin with (BC break!)
- fixed a typos in getAll, getAssoc and getCol
- test suite: moved set_time_limit() call to the setup script to be easier to customize
- renamed hasMore() to valid() due to changes in the PHP5 iterator API (BC break!)
- renamed toString() to __toString() in order to take advantage of new PHP5
  goodness and made it public
- MDB2_Driver_Datatype_Common::setResultTypes() can now handle missing elements
  inside type arrays: array(2 =&gt; &apos;boolean&apos;, 4 =&gt; &apos;timestamp&apos;)
- fixed potential warning due to manipulation query detection in the query*()
  and the get*() query+fetch methods
- added tests for fetchAll() and fetchCol()
- performance tweaks for fetchAll() and fetchCol()
- fixed MDB2_Driver_Manager_mysql::listTableIndexes()
- fixed MDB2_Driver_Common::debug()
- renamed MDB2::isResult() to MDB2::isResultCommon()
- added base result class MDB2_Result from which all result sets should be
  inherited and added MDB2::isResult() which checks if a given object extends from it
- added &apos;result_wrap_class&apos; option and optional parameter to query() to enable
  wrapping of result classes into an arbitrary class
- added $result_class param to all drivers where it was missing from the
  query() and _executePrepared() methods
- applied several fixes to the PEAR::DB wrapper
- fixed a typo in MDB2_Driver_Reverse_pgsql::tableInfo()

- removed decimal_factor property to allow changing of decimal_places option
- using native escape string methods in sqlite and mysql driver
- fixed minor conformance issues in tableInfo() in the oci8 and mysql driver

    <notes>This is the first alpha release of MDB2 2.0.

MDB2 2.x breaks backwards compatibility in many ways in order to simplify
the API for both users and drivers developers.

Please note that currently only the MySQL, the PostGreSQL and the Oracle driver
have been tested to pass the test suite.

Here follows a short list of the most important changes:
- all code that is not necessary for basic operation is now separateed
  into separate modules which can be loaded with the loadModule() method
- all datatype related methods have been moved to a dataype module with
  the notable exception of getValue() and the newly introduced getDeclaration()
- added extended module for highlevel methods
- all manager method are no longer available in the core class and or
  now only available in the manager module
- all reverse engineering methods have been taken from the manager class
  and are now available through the reverse module
- a new module has been added to allow the addition of methods with
  RDBMS specific functionality (like getting the last autoincrement ID)
- LOB handling has been greatly simplified
- several methods names have been shortend
- the fetch.+() methods do not free the result set anymore
- the Manager and the reverse_engineer_xml_schema have been moved into
  a Tools directory
- all parameters are now lowercased with underscores as separators
- all drivers now support all of the dsn options that PEAR DB supports
- several methods have been removed because they offered redundant functionality
- changed prepare API type is now passed to prepare and not to setParam*()
- results are now wrapped inside objects and all methods which operate
  on resultsets have been moved into respecitive classes
- there are two types of result object: buffered (default) and unbuffered
- totally rewrote buffering and limit emulation
