This is a test framework for MDB2 built using PHPUnit. Currently all
the tests from the metabase driver_test.php have been ported.
These tests directly access the MDB2 API - hopefully this framework
should give better feedback as to where or what caused when error are encountered.

Usage:
In order for the tests to work they need to access a database called
"driver_test". This database is created in the manager test. If you have
problems running the manager test or the driver you are using does not yet
provide the necessary methods you may create the database manually. In the
future we will probably provide SQL files for every supported database.

To setup the tests

* requires PHPUnit to be installed

* requires MDB2 to be installed in a php include path or the tests need to be
  moved into the MDB2 root path.

* copy the file test_setup.php.dist to test_setup.php

* edit test_setup.php. The array $testarray specifies which testcases
  to carry out. $dbarray is an array of databases to test.

* point your browser at test.php or your CLI at clitest.php for the results,
  and then fix the bugs!

* by default test.php/clitest.php will use all tests in the testcases - if
  you want to pick specific tests, use testchoose.php to pick just the
  tests you want to run

Writing tests:

The tests are written using PHPUnit from pear so first make sure you
have the latest stable release, and have read the docs,
